# tilegame

This is a tile game implementation I created as HTA for CS141 at Brown University during the Spring of 2017. The "Tile Game" is essentially a 3x3 grid with the numbers 1-9 on it. You have the ability to switch two adjacent tiles. Your goal is to arrange the board into the final goal orientation in the shortest way possible. This can be viewed as a search problem.
